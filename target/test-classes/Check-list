1. Positive checks
    a) Check the validation of a correct regular triangle (+ sides reshuffle); correct type = 4
    b) Check the validation of a correct isosceles triangle (+ sides reshuffle); correct type = 2
    c) Check the validation of a correct equilateral triangle; correct type = 3 (as equilateral triangle is isosceles by definition)
    d) Check the validation of a correct rectangular triangle (+ sides reshuffle); correct type = 8
    e) Check the validation of a correct rectangular and isosceles triangle (+ sides reshuffle); correct type = 10 (8 as rectangular + 2 as isosceles)
+ Thoughts:
  • it's useless to check incorrect types of passed parameters (char, String, ...) as compiler handles it by itself
  • the square of a valid triangle will always be counted correctly while square formula is correct

2. Negative checks
    a) Check that exception is caused under an attempt to validate incorrect triangle:
        - the sum of two sides is less than the 3d side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - the sum of two sides is equal to the 3d side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more null side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more negative side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more NaN side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more infinity side (+ sides reshuffle)
    b) Check that exception is caused under an attempt to count the square of incorrect triangle:
        - the sum of two sides is less than the 3d side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - the sum of two sides is equal to the 3d side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more null side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more negative side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more NaN side (+ sides reshuffle)
        - one or more infinity side (+ sides reshuffle)
+ Thoughts:
  • checks for NaN and infinities are not as important as checks for sums of sides, but they're added just in case we'll have a really angry and harmful user :)
